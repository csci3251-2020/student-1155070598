# Hello! 
My name is *Pareeyaporn Prachaseree* :woman_technologist:.

## Myself as a developer
There are many traits a good developer should have: 
- [x] Positive Attitude 
- [x] Good Team Player
- [x] Communication Skills 
- [x] Fast Learner
- [x] Time and Task Management 
- [x] Deep and Board Technical Experience 

I believe I do have some of these skills, but there is definitely room continuously improve on all these points.

## My experience on Github
Why is Github a handy tool for developers? Below are some reasons:
- Github is a respository
	- One of the largest coding communities
- Github allows you to track different code versions
- Github allows you to contribute on varieties of open-source projects
	- Others can also contribute to yours (if made public)
- Github allows you to showcase your work 
	- It is a great way to show recruiters :grinning: !
